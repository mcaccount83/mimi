                    Here are a few things to keep in mind as you start your MOMS Club journey.
                    <ul>
                        <li>All chapters are in PENDING status until reviewed by our Coordintaor Team.</li>
                        <li>After review, you will receive an email from your Coordinator to establish initial communication as well as verify/set your official chapter name
                            and boundaries.</li>
                        <li>After communication has been established, your credit card will be charged, your chapter will move to ACTIVE status and your official MOMS Club chapter manual will be shipped.</li>
                        <li>There are no refunds after the payment has been processed.</li>
                        <li>Check your application status any time by logging into MIMI with the credentials you set up during the application process. </li>
                        <li>In MIMI you will also see your Coordinator's contact information.  If you do not hear from them within a week of submitting your application, please reach out to them
                            directly as sometimes messages do end up in spam.</li>
                        <li>After your chapter has moved to ACTIVE status you'll see your MIMI options change to allow more access and infomration, but your login credentials will remain the same.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Log into MIMI - <a href="http://momsclub.org/mimi" target="_blank">http://momsclub.org/mimi</a><br>
