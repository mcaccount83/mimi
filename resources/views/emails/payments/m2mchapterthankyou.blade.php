Thank you for your group’s contribution of <b>${{$mailData['m2mDonation']}}</b> to the International MOMS Club’s Mother-To-Mother Fund!<br>
<br>
Your contribution will be added to the fund for use when a personal or natural disaster strikes MOMS Club members.  Please pass on to your members our congratulations for their generosity and compassion for their MOMS Club sisters.<br>
<br>
Because of their farsightedness in contributing to the Mother-To-Mother Fund now, emergency assistance will be available should a disaster strike a MOMS Club family in the future.<br>
<br>
Thank you again for helping!  Your members should be very proud of themselves!  I know we are very proud of all of you!<br>
<br>
<strong>MCL,</strong><br>
Mother-To-Mother Fund Committee
